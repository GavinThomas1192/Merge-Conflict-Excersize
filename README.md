# Merge-Conflict-Excersize

Hi this Aaron> this exercise was a mess. We made a team decision to make no mergers without the team together. AKA the merge party.
Adding something new because i hate git.

This assignment was difficult. It was almost harder to do it wrong. It caused much confusion trying to screw up git hub. I took away that we should utilize merge parties and two people should never be working on the same thing at the same time.
